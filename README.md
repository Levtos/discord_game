# Discord Game — Home Assistant Integration

Track Discord users' online status and currently played games directly in Home Assistant. For each monitored user the integration creates:

- **Status sensor** — online / idle / dnd / offline
- **Game sensor** — currently played game, or *No Game* when idle
- **Avatar sensor** — profile picture URL
- **Username sensor** — global Discord display name
- **Media player entity** — reflects the active game as a playback source (state: playing / idle / off)

All entities are grouped under one device per user. The user's avatar is used as the entity picture throughout.

> Special thanks to the developers and contributors who originally conceived and built the foundation this integration is based on.

## Setup

### 1 — Create a Discord bot

1. Go to <https://discord.com/developers/applications>
2. Click **New Application**, give it a name and confirm
3. Open the **Installation** tab and set the install link to *None*
4. Open the **Bot** tab and click **Add Bot**
5. Disable **Public Bot**
6. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents** enable all three intents (Presence, Server Members, Message Content)
7. Click **Save Changes**
8. Under **Token** click **Reset Token**, copy and store it securely — you will need it during integration setup

### 2 — Invite the bot to your server

1. Open the **General Information** tab and copy the **Client ID**
2. Open this URL in your browser (replace `[CLIENT_ID]`):
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&scope=bot&permissions=0
   ```
3. Select your server and click **Authorize**

The bot must be a member of the server where the users you want to track are active.

### 3 — Add the integration in Home Assistant

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for *Discord Game*
2. Paste your bot token
3. Select the avatar image format (`webp` recommended; use `png` for Safari / iOS)
4. On the next screen select the users to track and optionally channels for reaction tracking
5. Confirm — one device per user will appear with all sensors and the media player entity

## Notes

- **Safari / iOS:** Set image format to `png` — Safari does not support `webp`
- **Channel reactions:** Selecting a channel creates a sensor that shows the display name of the last user who added a reaction — useful for simple interaction tracking
- **Shared token:** The bot token is compatible with Home Assistant's built-in Discord notification integration, so both functions can run under the same bot
